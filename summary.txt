- talking about destructuring !


- the spread operator
    - ...  <- this is it
    - in front an array (any iterable) - evrything that can be iterated with a "for-of" loop : array, strings, dom notes, maps , sets etc.
    - if we need to convert a node list into an array there are 2 possibilities : 
        1. use Array.from ( an iterable object )
        2. use the spread operator like this : [...nodeList]
